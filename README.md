Adding Magellanic Stream coordinates to astropy.

Based on the coordinate system defined in Nidever et al. 2008 and on parameters provided by David Nidever. Python code based on example for the [Sagitarius Stream](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/generated/examples/coordinates/plot_sgr-coordinate-frame.html).

Currently a work in progress. Only Longitude and Latitude have been tested so far. Lots of work needs to be done to clean this up a bit and finish testing.
